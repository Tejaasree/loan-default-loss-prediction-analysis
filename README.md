# Loan Default & Loss Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a large credit risk dataset with 80,000+ loan records to understand the factors driving loan defaults and potential losses. I performed data validation, cleaning, imputation, and feature scaling to prepare the data for modeling. I followed a two-stage PD–LGD approach aligned with CECL and IFRS-9 standards to estimate default probability and loss severity. To handle class imbalance (~9% defaults), I applied class weighting and threshold tuning, evaluating performance using ROC–AUC (0.64). The results were translated into risk segmentation insights to support pricing decisions, portfolio risk monitoring, and capital planning.

## Data & Tools
- Data: Loan-level credit risk dataset (80,000+ records, 763 numeric features)
- Programming: Python, R, SQL
- Modeling: XGBoost, PD–LGD framework
- Evaluation: ROC–AUC, class imbalance handling
- Visualization & Reporting: PowerPoint, PDF report
